## Re-inventing the wheel.

There exists better and more featured unit testing frameworks in the JavaScript
echo system; Why then, would I go about creating another? **Academics**. <br/>

This project is purely an academic endeavor and _should not be used in actual development_.

## What's in a name ?

The allegory of the [Labors of Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labours_of_Hercules) <br/>
The names _Heracles_ and _Alcaeus_ were already taken on npm, so ... _Alcides_.
